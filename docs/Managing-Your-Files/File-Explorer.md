## Opening Existing File from Google Drive

### In order to access an existing file though Apps on Demand, said file will need to be stored in your Google Drive Account. You can learn about linking your Google Drive account to Apps on Demand here. If your file is not yet on your Google Drive account, you must upload it before you are able to open it within AppStream Applications.
