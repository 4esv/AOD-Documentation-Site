## Linking Google Drive 

### 1. Unlike previous years, students are not able to save work on the CHE computer lab monitors. Instead, Apps on Demand uses Google Drive to save files.  

### 2. It is highly recommended that you log into Google Drive using your Cornell NetID immediately after you access Apps on Demand 

### 3. You can log into your Google Drive at any time during your work session, however, it is best to do this before beginning to work. This way, one can access existing files on your Google drive account.  

### 4. To log in to Google Drive, you will need to click on the Google Drive File Stream.
